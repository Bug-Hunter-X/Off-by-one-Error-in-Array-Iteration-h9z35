This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java when iterating over arrays.  The `Bug.java` file contains code with the error.  `BugSolution.java` provides the corrected code.  The error occurs because the loop condition `i <= arr.length` attempts to access an index beyond the array's bounds, leading to an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. The solution uses the correct condition `i < arr.length`.
